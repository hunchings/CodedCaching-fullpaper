# CodedCaching-fullpaper
We study a well-known coded caching problem
within the framework of online learning theory. Specifically,
our focus is on minimizing the regret of a coded caching
problem with adversarial requests. To our knowledge, our study
marks the first examination of adversarial regret in coded
caching setup with a broadcast channel and coded delivery. To
minimize the regret, we introduce a policy based on Follow-
The-Perturbed-Leader. Through comparative analysis between
our algorithm and a static oracle, we demonstrate that our
policy achieves sub-linear regret of O(âˆšT ). Furthermore, we
also address the issue of switching costs by establishing an upper
bound on the expected number of switches in our algorithm
under unrestricted switching conditions, and we provide an
upper bound on adversarial regret under restricted switching.
Additionally, we validate our theoretical insights with numerical
results on a real-time Movielens dataset
